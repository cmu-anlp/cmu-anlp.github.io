      Natural language processing technology attempts to model human language with computers, tackling a wide variety of problems from automatic translation to question answering.
      CS11-711 Advanced Natural Language Processing (at <a href="http://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <a href="http://lti.cs.cmu.edu">Language Technology Institute</a>) is an introductory graduate-level course on natural language processing aimed at students who are interested in doing cutting-edge research in the field. In it, we describe fundamental tasks in natural language processing such as syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis, as well as methods to solve these tasks. The course focuses on modern methods using neural networks, and covers the basic modeling and learning algorithms required therefore. The class culminates in a project in which students attempt to reimplement and improve upon a research paper in a topic of their choosing.
